# principles_of_data_analytics

## Experience

Hi there, my name is David Byrne and you are currently reading my README.md for this repository. I have some very basic understanding of coding in Python, and some more understanding of writing in Markdown from using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a personal note taking app.

This README will be updated to be more appropriate to the contents of this repository as I add coursework to it.
