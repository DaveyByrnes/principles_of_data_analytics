# principles_of_data_analytics

by David Byrne


## Experience

Hi there, my name is David Byrne and you are currently reading my README.md for this repository. I have some very basic understanding of coding in Python, and some more understanding of writing in Markdown from using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a personal note taking app.

This repository will showcase my growing skills in several categories, including python programming fundementals, data visualisation, statistical analysis and documentation.

## Project

This project is an analysis of the Iris dataset. It examines and explores data analysis, the relationship between the different features within the dataset and visualisation.
